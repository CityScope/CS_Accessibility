# CS_Accessibility
A Cityscope module for calculating accessibility metrics by walking and public transit.
Access to jobs, restaurants, education or any other amenity for which we have location information can be calculated.
Accessibility can be calculated by walking only or by a combination of walking and public transit.

This module makes use of the [urbanaccess](https://github.com/UDST/urbanaccess) and [pandana](https://github.com/UDST/pandana) modules of the [Urban Data Science Toolkit](https://github.com/UDST).
